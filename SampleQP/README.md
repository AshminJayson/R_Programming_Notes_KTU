    ```

    Output:
    Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max.
    10 20 30 30 40 50

    The summary function displays the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum values of the dataset.

7. Q: List any three graphics functions in R.

    A: Three graphics functions in R are:

    - plot(): The plot() function is used to create various types of plots, such as scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and histograms.

    - ggplot(): The ggplot() function from the ggplot2 package allows for the creation of sophisticated and customized visualizations using a "grammar of graphics" approach.

    - hist(): The hist() function is used to create histograms to visualize the distribution of numeric data.

8. Q: Explain the Lattice function.

    A: The Lattice function in R is a part of the lattice package, which provides a powerful and flexible framework for creating trellis plots. Trellis plots are multi-paneled plots that can display relationships between multiple variables. The lattice package is based on the idea of conditioning, where each panel of the plot represents a subset of the data based on one or more variables. The Lattice function allows you to create various types of plots, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and box plots, with the ability to easily add additional conditioning variables or customize the appearance of the plot.

9. Q: Suppose that you have a dataset D1 and you design a linear regression model of a degree 3 polynomial, and you found that the training and testing error is "0" or in other terms it perfectly fits the data. What will happen when you fit a degree 2 polynomial in linear regression?

    A: If a degree 3 polynomial linear regression model perfectly fits the data with training and testing errors of 0, it suggests that the model is likely overfitting the data. In such cases, fitting a degree 2 polynomial in linear regression may result in a more generalizable and less complex model. A degree 2 polynomial model has fewer parameters and is less flexible, which can help prevent overfitting and provide a better balance between bias and variance.

10. Q: Explain the logistic regression function in R.

    A: The logistic regression function in R is used for modeling binary or categorical outcomes. It is commonly used in classification problems where the dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no, success/failure). The logistic regression function estimates the probability of a binary outcome by fitting a logistic curve to the data. In R, logistic regression can be performed using the `glm()` function with the family argument set to "binomial". It applies the logistic function to the linear predictor to model the relationship between the predictor variables and the probability of the binary outcome. The resulting logistic regression model can be used to predict the probability of the outcome for new observations based on their predictor variables.

```

Output:
The modified data frame `airquality_new` will contain all the columns of the "airquality" dataset except for 'Solar.R' and 'Wind'.

15.b Q: Explain transformation functions in R.

A: Transformation functions in R are used to modify or transform data in various ways. They allow us to manipulate variables and derive new features from existing data. Here are some commonly used transformation functions in R:

1. `sqrt(x)`: Computes the square root of each element in vector `x`.
2. `log(x)`: Computes the natural logarithm of each element in vector `x`.
3. `exp(x)`: Computes the exponential value (e^x) of each element in vector `x`.
4. `round(x, digits)`: Rounds each element in vector `x` to the specified number of `digits` decimal places.
5. `abs(x)`: Computes the absolute value of each element in vector `x`.
6. `toupper(x)`: Converts each character in character vector `x` to uppercase.
7. `tolower(x)`: Converts each character in character vector `x` to lowercase.
8. `paste(x, y)`: Concatenates elements of vectors `x` and `y` into a single character vector.
9. `gsub(pattern, replacement, x)`: Replaces occurrences of `pattern` with `replacement` in character vector `x`.
10. `cut(x, breaks)`: Divides the numeric vector `x` into intervals defined by `breaks`.
11. `scale(x)`: Centers and scales each column of matrix or data frame `x`.

These transformation functions can be applied to vectors, matrices, or data frames, depending on the requirements of the transformation. They are helpful in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and preparing data for analysis or modeling.

16.a Q: Write R code to generate the probability distribution table for the number of successes from a binomial distribution where n=5 and the probability of success in each trial is 0.25.

A: Here's an example of R code to generate the probability distribution table for the number of successes from a binomial distribution where n=5 and the probability of success in each trial is 0.25:

n <- 5  # Number of trials
p <- 0.25  # Probability of success

dist_table <- round(dbinom(0:n, size = n, prob = p), 3)
print(dist_table)
```

Output:
The `dist_table` will display the probability distribution table for the number of successes from the binomial distribution with n=5 and p=0.25. It will provide the probability of obtaining 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 successes.

19.a Q: Illustrate model fitting in simple linear model.

A: Here's an example to illustrate model fitting in a simple linear model using the lm() function in R:

```R
# Create sample data
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

# Fit a simple linear regression model
model <- lm(y ~ x)

# Print the model summary
summary(model)
```

Output:
The output will display the coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values for the intercept and slope of the linear regression model. It also provides information on the residual standard error, R-squared value, and F-statistic.

19.b Q: Explain different types of regression.

A: Regression analysis is a statistical modeling technique used to examine the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. There are various types of regression models based on the characteristics of the dependent and independent variables. Here are some commonly used types of regression:

1. Simple Linear Regression: This type of regression involves a single independent variable and a linear relationship with the dependent variable. It models the relationship using a straight line equation.

2. Multiple Linear Regression: Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to include multiple independent variables. It models the relationship between the dependent variable and multiple predictors using a linear equation.

3. Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression models the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s) by using polynomial functions of higher degrees. It allows for nonlinear relationships by fitting curves instead of straight lines.

4. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is binary or categorical. It models the probability of an event occurring based on the independent variables using the logistic function.

5. Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is a type of regularized regression that adds a penalty term to the regression equation to address multicollinearity. It helps to reduce the impact of correlated predictors.

6. Lasso Regression: Lasso regression is another type of regularized regression that uses a penalty term to shrink coefficients and perform feature selection. It can set some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively excluding certain predictors from the model.

7. Elastic Net Regression: Elastic Net regression is a combination of ridge and lasso regression. It combines the penalties of both methods to address multicollinearity and perform feature selection.

8. Poisson Regression: Poisson regression is used when the dependent variable represents count data. It models the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables using the Poisson distribution.

These are just a few examples of regression models, and there are many other variations and extensions depending on the specific characteristics and assumptions of the data. The choice of regression model depends on the nature of the data and the research question being addressed.

20.a Q: Describe the unusual observations in the regression model.

A: Unusual observations, also known as outliers, in a regression model are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern or trend of the data. They can have a substantial impact on the regression analysis and the interpretation of the results. Here are some characteristics of unusual observations:

1. High leverage points: These are observations with extreme values of predictor variables. They can disproportionately influence the regression model's fit, particularly if they are far from the average values of the predictors.

2. Outliers: Outliers are observations with response values that deviate significantly from the predicted values based on the regression line. They can exert substantial influence on the estimation of regression coefficients and affect the overall fit of the model.

3. Influential points: Influential points are observations that have a strong influence on the regression model's parameters. They can have a considerable effect on the estimated coefficients, standard errors, and predictions.

Unusual observations can distort the regression line, affect the model's statistical significance, increase the variability of the residuals, and reduce the model's overall predictive accuracy. It is essential to identify and handle these observations appropriately to ensure the reliability and validity of the regression analysis.

20.b Q: Explain corrective measures of unusual observations in regression modeling.

A: Corrective measures for unusual observations in regression modeling involve identifying, assessing, and appropriately handling the outliers or influential points. Here are some common corrective measures:

1. Data inspection and validation: Examine the data for any errors or anomalies. Verify the accuracy of data entry, measurements, and recording. If errors are found, correct or remove them before performing the analysis.

2. Visualize the data: Plot the data, including scatter plots, residual plots, or leverage plots, to identify outliers and influential points. Visual inspection can help determine if the observations are genuine or due to data entry errors.

3. Robust regression techniques: Consider using robust regression methods that are less sensitive to outliers, such as robust regression, which downweights the influence of outliers in the estimation process.

4. Sensitivity analysis: Assess the impact of excluding or downweighting the unusual observations on the regression model's results. Evaluate whether the model's conclusions and inferences change significantly without those observations.

5. Data transformation: Apply transformations to the variables to achieve linearity, stabilize the variance, or mitigate the impact of outliers. Common transformations include logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox transformations.

6. Outlier removal: In certain cases, outliers that are determined to be erroneous or due to data quality issues can be removed from the analysis. However, this should be done cautiously, ensuring that the reasons for their exclusion are well-justified.

7. Robust standard errors: Calculate robust standard errors to account for the potential influence of outliers on the model's estimated coefficients and standard errors. Robust standard errors provide more reliable inference in the presence of outliers.

8. Documentation and reporting: Clearly document and report the presence of unusual observations, the methods used to identify and handle them, and the rationale behind the chosen corrective measures. Transparent reporting helps ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the analysis.

It is crucial to carefully evaluate and consider the nature of the data, the research objectives, and the impact of unusual observations when deciding on the appropriate corrective measures. The goal is to strike a balance between removing influential points that are detrimental to the analysis and preserving the integrity and representativeness of the data.
